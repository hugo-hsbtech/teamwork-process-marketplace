A portable, PO-facing Claude skill that turns a **Product Ready origination-record** —
the triaged output of `/hsb-teamwork:origination-brainstorm` — into a fully-frozen
**Readiness Package (RP)**: the Product Owner's rationalization artefact.

The RP contains: executive summary, problem/context, objectives, personas,
scope in/out, business rules, user stories with Given/When/Then acceptance
criteria, NFRs, edge cases, metrics, release criteria, and risks.

> This README is the orientation. The authoritative spec lives in
> [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) (the orchestrator) and [`references/`](references/).

## The big idea

The pipeline **pre-fills every section before the PO sees the document** — the
screen looks like the system already rationalized the demand and is asking for
the PO's judgment, not like a blank form. The PO's job is to **review, edit,
justify, and freeze**.

Two principles underpin correctness and parallelism:

1. **Draft-then-confirm.** `readiness-inheritor` carries inheritable sections
   forward from the origination-record at preserved confidence; `readiness-drafter`
   proposes first drafts for the new product sections. Every section has an
   entry — `inherited`, `ai_drafted`, or an honest `discovery` — before the PO
   opens the document. Questions are a fallback, not the primary mode.
2. **One writer per file.** `readiness-document.md` is written exclusively by
   `origination-doc-updater`; `qa-log.md` is written exclusively by
   `origination-ledger-writer`. All three `readiness-*` agents are read-only proposers;
   the orchestrator routes their proposals through the single writers.

## How to invoke

```
/hsb-teamwork:readiness-package
```

When you invoke it, have the path to the demand's origination session folder ready
(the `<demand-slug>/` folder produced by `origination-brainstorm`). The skill will
confirm the origination-record path, resolve-or-resume the
`<demand-slug>-readiness/` session folder, and default the output language to
pt-BR unless you specify otherwise.

## Input

A **Product Ready origination-record** — the `target-document.md` (or its
`output/humanized.md`) produced by `/hsb-teamwork:origination-brainstorm` after the
demand has been triaged to `Product Ready` status.

The PO provides:
- The origination session folder path (e.g. `SESSION_ROOT/<demand-slug>/`).
- Optionally: additional files to index (specs, research, prior ADRs).
- Optionally: a custom RP template (if not using the default).

## Outputs

All artifacts land in `SESSION_ROOT/<demand-slug>-readiness/`:

```

├── sources-index.md            # index of ingested inputs (incl. origination-record)

    └── manifest.md             # index of all artifacts + freeze state + TA flag
```

## The Technical Assessment boundary

The RP stops at product definition. Technical viability and architectural
constraints belong to the CTO's **Technical Assessment** — a separate artefact.

`readiness-escalation-flagger` detects architectural triggers (infrastructure
changes, multi-tenancy, AI/runtime behaviour, security/auth, external integrations
with unknowns) and proposes the compound shape `TechAssessmentRef.status =
requested` AND `disposition = deferred` — the `deferred` disposition is what the
manifest propagates downstream and what makes the freeze provisional.

**Current state — provisional freeze:** the `tech-assessment` skill does not yet
exist. When a Technical Assessment is owed, the RP freezes **provisionally**: the
product sections are frozen and `output/manifest.md` is flagged
`tech-assessment-ref: deferred (TA pending — out of current tooling scope)`, so
the downstream PRD/PM handoff knows the Assessment is still owed.

When the `tech-assessment` skill lands, the freeze gate will be tightened to
require a signed TA. Until then, the provisional-freeze path is the intended
behavior and is documented in
[`references/escalation.md`](references/escalation.md).

## Modes

- **Fresh** (default) — origination-record exists, no RP yet. Full pipeline.
- **Revisit** — existing `readiness-document.md` in the session folder. Re-score,
  report the gap map, re-open questions only on weak sections.
- **Batch / headless** — a set of origination-records, no live PO. No-question draft
  path; output is always "draft for review," never frozen on its own.

## Using it elsewhere

In **this repo** it already works — symlinked into `.claude/` from the plugin.

To reuse it in **other projects**, install it as a Claude Code plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add hugo-hsbtech/teamwork-process-marketplace
/plugin install hsb-teamwork@hsb-tech
```

Then invoke it as `/hsb-teamwork:readiness-package`.

The three `readiness-*` agents (`readiness-inheritor`, `readiness-drafter`,
`readiness-escalation-flagger`) are defined in `agents/readiness-*.md` alongside
the origination agents.
